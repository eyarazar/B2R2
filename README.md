# B2R2-modulo-sampling
This repository contains Python implemtation for B2R2 (Beyond Bandwith Residual Recovery) -  a new method for recovering unfolded samples of a bandlimited input from its modulo samples. Based on the paper:

E. Azar, S. Mulleti and Y.C. Eldar

**"Residual Recovery Algorithm for Modulo Sampling".**

ICASSP 2022 - 2022 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), Singapore.

To evaluate B2R2, you can use the provided code example in the `test_B2R2.py` script. The implementation of the algorithm can be found in the script `B2R2.py`.
